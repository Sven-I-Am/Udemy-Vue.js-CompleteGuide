# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

## Assignment 5 - Conditional Content

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
This course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.

## exercise

we're building a simple app where:

- a user can input tasks and add the to a dynamic list by clicking the button
- the user can toggle the list visibility with another button
- bonus: the text on the show/hide list button changes dynamically

### summary

very fun exercise, I started off by solving it using css classes and binding those. but the second solve was done using only the v-if, v-else and v-for for content rendering.
