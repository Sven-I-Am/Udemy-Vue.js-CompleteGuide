# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).The course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.  
This repository will hold all the follow along exercises as well as the assignments given throughout the course.
