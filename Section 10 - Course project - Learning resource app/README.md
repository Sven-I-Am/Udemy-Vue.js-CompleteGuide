# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

## Course project 1 - The monster slaying game

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
This course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.

## exercise

we're building an app that holds a list of learning resources:

- user can switch between stored resources and add resources tabs
- user can add resources
- user can delete resources
- user can view stored resources
- using components and all we learned so far
- a starter structure is provided

### summary

very fun exercise, I started off by solving it using css classes and binding those. but the second solve was done using only the v-if, v-else and v-for for content rendering.
