# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

## Assignment 1 - Data binding

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
This course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.

## exercise

This is the first assignment in the course. We're building a simple app that shows our name, age, age in 5 years, a random number, an image and an input field that is pre-populated with our name.

### summary

this basic exercise was actually really easy to do. I feel like I understand the data binding well enough to use it as intended.
