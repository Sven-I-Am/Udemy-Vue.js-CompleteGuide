# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

## Assignment 3 - Reactivity

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
This course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.

## exercise

we're building a simple app where:

- we have two buttons we need to link to a method
- those methods calculate a value
- the output should be as follows:
  - value < 37 => 'Not there yet'
  - value > 37 => 'Too much'
  - value = 37 => 37
- we listen to changes in result and reset the value to 0 if there's no changes after 5 seconds

### summary

very easy exercise again, the difference between computed and watch became pretty clear.
