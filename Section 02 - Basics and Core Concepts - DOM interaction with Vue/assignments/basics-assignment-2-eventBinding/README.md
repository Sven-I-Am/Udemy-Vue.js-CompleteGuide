# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

## Assignment 2 - Event Binding

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
This course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.

## exercise

This is the second assignment in the course. We're building a simple app that:

- shows an alert on button click
- register user input on keydown and output live
- repeat previous but only update output when ENTER is hit

### summary

Again, very easy to figure out. Just had to apply what I already knew and it worked. I did notice that the keydown event causes the output to be behind by one character
