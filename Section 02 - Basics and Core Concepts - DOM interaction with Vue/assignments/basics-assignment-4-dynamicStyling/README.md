# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

## Assignment 4 - Dynamic styling

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
This course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.

## exercise

we're building a simple app where:

- style a paragraph based on user input (user1 or user2)
- bind the button to toggle the style of the above paragraph to visible or hidden
- use dynamic inline styling to style a paragraph (background-color) based on user input

### summary

very easy exercise again, the difference between computed and watch became pretty clear.
