# Udemy - Vue.js - The full guide

## Course project 1 - The monster slaying game

I'm currently following ["Vue - The complete guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
This course has been fully updated to Vue3 and should give me a pretty decent understanding of the framework.

## exercise

we're building a game:

- user vs computer (aka slayer vs monster)
- we're using everything we've learned so far and implementing it into our app to build a fun little game where the user fights a monster with:
  - battle log (list of events)
  - buttons for different action (attack, special attack, heal, surrender)
  - game outcome
  - health-bars

### summary

very fun exercise, I started off by solving it using css classes and binding those. but the second solve was done using only the v-if, v-else and v-for for content rendering.
